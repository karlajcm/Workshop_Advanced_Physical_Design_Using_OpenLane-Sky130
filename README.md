# Workshop_Advanced_Physical_Design_Using_OpenLane-Sky130


# Day 1 - Inception of open-source EDA, OpenLANE and Sky130 PDK

## SKY130_D1_SK3 - Get familiar to open-source EDA tools

## SKY_L1 - OpenLANE Directory structure in detail

Inside the next path we will find 3 files: skywater-pdk, open-pdks, sky130A. As itâ€™s shown below.

```jsx
cd /Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/pdks
```

![Untitled](Day%201%20a881c85ccd0049e892fda7e0c9aaeb3e/Untitled.png)

- skywater-pdk â†’ It has all the files related to the pdk: timing libraries, cell files, etc.
- open-pdks â†’ Foundry files that are not made for Open-EDA Tools. These were processed so that free tools can open them.
- sky130A â†’ It has two folders:
    - libs.ref â†’ Specifically for technology (sky130_fd_sc_hvl, sky130_fd_pr_rf, ect). We will be working specifically with sky130_fd_sc_hd
    - libs.tech â†’ Specifically for tools (klayout, ngspice, netgen, magic, etc)

ðŸ“Œ Take care: OpenLane is not a tool, it is a flow which contains many Open-source EDA Tools.

## SKY_L2 - Design Preparation Step

To launch OpenLane Flow, we have to open a terminal and type the next commands:

```jsx
cd /Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane
docker
./flow.tcl -interactive
```

Then, OpenLane is launched:

![Untitled](Day%201%20a881c85ccd0049e892fda7e0c9aaeb3e/Untitled%201.png)

We will need to input all the packages required:

```jsx
package require openlane 0.9
```

![Untitled](Day%201%20a881c85ccd0049e892fda7e0c9aaeb3e/Untitled%202.png)

In another terminal, we go to the next path:

```jsx
cd Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/designs
```

![Untitled](Day%201%20a881c85ccd0049e892fda7e0c9aaeb3e/Untitled%203.png)

We open **picorv32a** file. And we type:

```jsx
less config.tcl
```

![Untitled](Day%201%20a881c85ccd0049e892fda7e0c9aaeb3e/Untitled%204.png)

Later we configure the design in the terminal in which we open OpenLane.

```jsx
prep -design picorv32a
```

![Untitled](Day%201%20a881c85ccd0049e892fda7e0c9aaeb3e/Untitled%205.png)

Here what itâ€™s doing is combining the 2 files (the design and the configuration file). This can be confirmed by going to the path, where a folder called "runs" should appear:

```jsx
cd Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/designs/picorv32a
```

![Untitled](Day%201%20a881c85ccd0049e892fda7e0c9aaeb3e/Untitled%206.png)

## SKY_L3 - Review files after design prep and run synthesis

Later we open **runs** file. We will find a file with the date on which the commands were run to create the **runs file**.

![Untitled](Day%201%20a881c85ccd0049e892fda7e0c9aaeb3e/Untitled%207.png)

Opening the ***date*** fileâ€¦

![Untitled](Day%201%20a881c85ccd0049e892fda7e0c9aaeb3e/Untitled%208.png)

![Untitled](Day%201%20a881c85ccd0049e892fda7e0c9aaeb3e/Untitled%209.png)

All folders will be empty except "tmp". If we open it, for example, we can open the file "merged.lef" withâ€¦

```jsx
less merged.lef
```

![Untitled](Day%201%20a881c85ccd0049e892fda7e0c9aaeb3e/Untitled%2010.png)

![Untitled](Day%201%20a881c85ccd0049e892fda7e0c9aaeb3e/Untitled%2011.png)

Back in the date folder, we can open **config.tcl**. This file shows which parameters are taken into account for the run.

![Untitled](Day%201%20a881c85ccd0049e892fda7e0c9aaeb3e/Untitled%2012.png)

![Untitled](Day%201%20a881c85ccd0049e892fda7e0c9aaeb3e/Untitled%2013.png)

Back in the openlane flow we type:

```jsx
run_synthesis
```

## SKY_L5 - Steps to characterize synthesis results

Among the things that we can see as a result is.... Chip area.

![Untitled](Day%201%20a881c85ccd0049e892fda7e0c9aaeb3e/Untitled%2015.png)

In addition, in the statistics we can see... Number of cells and number of flip-flops (sky130_fd_sc_dfxtp_2)

![Untitled](Day%201%20a881c85ccd0049e892fda7e0c9aaeb3e/Untitled%2016.png)

We can calculate Flop Ratioâ€¦

$$
FlopRatio = \frac{No.ofFlipFlops}{No.ofCells}
$$

![Untitled](Day%201%20a881c85ccd0049e892fda7e0c9aaeb3e/Untitled%2017.png)

Going back to the date folder, we can go to the results folder: "results" and open the "synthesis" folder. There we will find the synthesized netlist. Called... "picorv32a.synthesis.v", where you can see that the abc has done all the mapping.

![Untitled](Day%201%20a881c85ccd0049e892fda7e0c9aaeb3e/Untitled%2018.png)

![Untitled](Day%201%20a881c85ccd0049e892fda7e0c9aaeb3e/Untitled%2019.png)

Going back to the date folder, we can enter the reports folder: "reports", and then the "synthesis" folder. We can open the most recent one which will correspond to the "stat report" â†’ "yosys_2.stat.rpt"

```jsx
less 1-yosys_4.stat.rpt
```

![Untitled](Day%201%20a881c85ccd0049e892fda7e0c9aaeb3e/Untitled%2020.png)

![Untitled](Day%201%20a881c85ccd0049e892fda7e0c9aaeb3e/Untitled%2021.png)

We can also review other reportsâ€¦

- less opensta.rpt
    
    ![Untitled](Day%201%20a881c85ccd0049e892fda7e0c9aaeb3e/Untitled%2022.png)
    
- less opensta_main.timing.rpt
    
    ![Untitled](Day%201%20a881c85ccd0049e892fda7e0c9aaeb3e/Untitled%2023.png)

ðŸ’¡ Take care: To return to the terminal, after entering the command "less (file)", press the Q key.
